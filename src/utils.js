    "I was just writing in my “What's new in since CSS3?” article about recent and possible future changes to CSS colors. It's weirdly a lot. There are just as many or more new and upcoming ways to define colors than what we have now. I thought we'd take a really quick look. First, a major heads up. This stuff is so complicated. I barely understand it. But here are some aspects: Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB as a color model, and everything dealt with that. We had different “color spaces” that handled it differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that RGB color model as a cube with linear coordinates, the hsl() function mapped that RGB color model as a cylinder) but it was all sRGB gamut. With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color models and (!) we're getting new functions that map that color model differently. So I think it's kind of a double-triple whammy.",
